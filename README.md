Home of the Rexist colortheme for the Micro text editor &amp; related tools for the Micro text editor.
The theme and/or settings can be installed manually, but these instructions make it easy to start from scratch.

# Clone the project to your computer
`git clone https://github.com/reginaldford/mycro`

# Install Micro if necessary

`cd mycro`

The following will not install micro, but will copy the supposed convenience script from getmic.ro

`./get_micro.sh`

Check the newly downloaded file `script_from_the_web.sh`

On April 26, 2023, the md5 sum was

If all is good, run it:

 `./script_from_the_web.sh`

Install it, perhaps with

`sudo mv -f micro /usr/local/bin/micro`

# Install the colortheme and settings
Run 

`./install_rexist.sh`

Enjoy
